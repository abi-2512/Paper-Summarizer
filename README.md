# üîç Research Paper Summarizer

A powerful tool for analyzing long-form research papers. This app uses cutting-edge NLP models to **summarize full papers**, **rank sentences by ethical relevance**, and **detect bias or inconsistencies** ‚Äî all in a clean Streamlit interface.

---

## üöÄ Features

### üß† AI-Powered Summarization

* Utilizes **Long-T5 (`google/long-t5-tglobal-base`)** to handle long documents up to \~16,000 tokens.
* Extracts a concise, high-quality summary from the full paper.

### üí¨ Ethical Sentence Ranking

* Ranks sentences by relevance to ethical concerns using **semantic similarity** with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Bias Detection

* Runs **zero-shot classification** (`facebook/bart-large-mnli`) to label sentences as:

  * `BIAS`
  * `INCONSISTENT`
  * `SOUND`

### üñ• Clean UI via Streamlit

* Upload `.txt` research papers or choose from provided samples
* See summary, top ethical sentences, and sentence-level bias analysis
* Download the generated summary

## üìÅ Sample Papers Included

* **AlexNet**
* **Attention is All You Need**
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

All located in the `samples/` directory as `.txt` files.

## üõ† Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-paper-analyzer.git
   cd research-paper-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch + Transformers
* Streamlit
* SentenceTransformers
* GPU (optional but recommended for speed)

---

## üß™ Known Issues

* ‚ùó Large files >16,000 tokens are truncated ‚Äî proper chunking support is not yet implemented (this is why it can only analyze abstracts and conclusions)
* ‚ùó Bias classification is experimental and should not be used for formal reviews
* ‚ùó Sentence segmentation may be imperfect for poorly formatted `.txt` files

---

## üå± Future Improvements

* [ ] Chunk long documents and stitch multi-part summaries
* [ ] Improve bias classification with fine-tuned models
* [ ] Add visual heatmaps for ethical sentence relevance
* [ ] PDF upload + parsing support
* [ ] Save full analysis reports (PDF/Markdown)
